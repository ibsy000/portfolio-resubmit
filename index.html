            </strong>
            <p> Growing up, my brother was always the <q><em>techy</em></q> one. He always wanted
                the newest gaming console or he was learning about computers or 
                he would take electronics apart and put them back together. I was
                right there beside him interested in what he was doing or I 
                was playing video games with him. When I got a little older, my
                brother passed down an old thick, heavy laptop to me. He taught
                me how to use emulators to play old games for the N64, NES, 
                GameBoy, GameCube, and so on. I <b><u>loved</u></b> 
                that laptop! (I still have it <em>somewhere</em>!) When I 
                was old enough to get a job in high school I would save up my 
                wages to buy my own consoles. We started to compete with each
                other on who would get the newest console first. We actually 
                still do that to this day. As we got older, my brother started to
                get really into gaming computers. He started to learn all the
                ins and outs of what makes a computer function. It was like he
                was speaking a different language! At this point, I was 
                focused on schoolwork, work work, and extracurricular activities.
                We didn't see each other very often then because we had our own
                things going on.<br><br>
                <strong><em>>>Fast forward a few years.</em></strong> 
                At this point, I am engaged to my <em>best-est</em> friend, we 
                own a home, have three fur-babies, and have stable jobs. I think
                to myself, <q><em>I should look into gaming computers! It's time to
                <strong>level up</strong> my gaming! </em></q> I got some advice
                from my brother and did some of my own research as well. I decided
                to buy a budget-friendly-VR-capable gaming computer and a VR setup
                because I had to <b>1-UP</b> my brother, of course. I found my
                new <b>passion</b>! Not only did I enjoy the entire gaming aspect,
                but I also spent endless hours going through every directory, 
                every setting, researching components, always learning. I have
                fun trying to understand how things work. I utilized my knowledge
                in my jobs and was always helpful when there were new updates, 
                software, applications, computers, and so on.<br><br>  
                <strong><em>>>>Fast fast forward to this year.</em></strong> My
                fiance and I just finished remodeling our house earlier this year. 
                We also just recently lost two of our dogs, which was really tough 
                for both of us. We also had truck problems and a well that 
                decided to quit working. We were at a point in our lives 
                where we wanted to make a change. We didn't feel fulfilled in 
                the area we lived in or with our jobs. At this point, the 
                housing market is so high we decided to sell our house
                and <q>retire</q> for a while until the market drops to purchase or
                build a new home in a new area. We wanted to travel after selling
                our house but the gas prices also <em>skyrocketed</em>. We don't 
                want to blow through our profits on gas, that's <b>no fun</b>.
                Family offered their home to us until we can find a rental property
                in the meantime. During my free time I was thinking about what
                my next career path would be. Then I stumbled upon the <em>
                answer!</em> I saw an advertisement online for Career Karma and
                my first thoughts were, <em><q>This is a scam. This has got to be
                a scam. Go to a bootcamp and get certified in a tech field in 
                less than a year? I have to see if this is legit.</q></em><br><br> After
                some research, I came to the conclusion that it's not a scam. I
                signed up, attended a few live sessions explaining bootcamps and the
                different tech career paths. I felt like this is <em>exactly</em> 
                what I have been looking for. I talked to my fiance first to see
                what he thinks about it and he supports me 100%! I began researching
                bootcamps to find the right one for me. After looking at a few
                options, I found <strong><u>Coding Temple</u></strong>. This school
                stood out right away. They are transparent about what they have
                to offer throughout the entire website. By the end of reviewing
                their page, I only had one question, <q><b>Where do I sign up?</b>
                </q> The enrollment process was so easy, quick, and streamlined. 
                <br><br>I explained my plans to my family, my fiance's family, 
                and my friends. My brother says to me, <q><em>Welcome to the 
                nerd club.</em></q> They have all been super supportive and have
                been cheering me on for success! I am so <strong>excited
                </strong> about learning everything I can about software engineering 
                in this cohort. So far, the pre-work has been a little 
                overwhelming and stressful, but ultimately it's been really <em>
                fun</em> for me. I never want to stop learning! After this cohort,
                I plan on getting a job in the industry for a while and  
                continue learning new tech paths. My ultimate goal is to learn 
                how to make my own video games and continue to do that until
                I'm ready to really <em><b>retire!</b></em>

            </strong>
            <p>From my previous article I explained how much I like computers
                and gaming, but those aren't the <em>only</em> things that peek 
                my interest!  I really enjoy playing board and card games. I've
                hosted many game nights at my house that have been a <b>blast!</b>
                Card games I like: <b>Blackjack, Circle of Death, Crabs Adjust
                Humidity, Uno, Speed,</b> anything really, those are just my top
                choices. One thing my fiance picks on me for is playing
                <b>Solitaire and Mahjong</b> on my new beastly gaming computer. 
                I can't help it though! I <strong>love</strong> those games! 
                <br><br>
                Board games I like: <b>Checkers, Munchkin, Blokus, Clue, Quelf,
                Monopoly, Battleship, Jenga, and more!</b> My favorite would have to
                be Munchkin hands-down! If you have never played it with your
                friends, you should definitely try it out! Basically it's a 
                role-playing game with an assortment of characters such as: 
                <b>elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs, etc.</b> The goal is to go 
                through dungeons, defeat the monster inside to move on to the next
                dungeon, and be the first one to defeat the monster in the final
                dungeon to win the game. Your friends can either <em>help</em> 
                you in battle for a reward or your friends can <em>backstab</em> 
                you by helping the monster defeat you and pay the consequences! 
                It's a fast-paced, silly game that comes with many expansion 
                packs as well. I currently own a few: <b>Rick and Morty, Marvel, 
                Nightmare Before Christmas, Adventure Time, and the original 
                Munchkin.</b>
                <br><br>
                Enough about inside activities, I like to go outside too, I 
                <em>swear!</em> My fiance is my <em><strong>best friend</strong></em> 
                for a reason, we like to do the same stuff, but we have separate 
                hobbies as well. We like to go to the park with our truck full
                of our outdoor activities equipment so we can have a range of
                options. Our equipment constists of: <b>mountain bikes, footballs,
                soccer ball, basketball, tenniballs and rackets, skateboards, 
                kites, softballs and mits, frisbees, etc.</b> Sometimes we will
                meet up with our friends or family for <q><em>park day</em></q> 
                and we will usually end up playing with everything! Aside from 
                the park we enjoy going on <b>hikes, canoeing, camping, fishing, 
                and walks.</b> The most scenic areas we go to are in Arkansas, 
                which can be anywhere from a 40 min drive to a 3 hour drive and 
                I usually like to do the 3 hour drives.
                <br><br>
                Now it's time for me to rant about a few fun facts about me! I
                love cudding with my dog, he is just the <em>cutest</em>. I love
                eating. If I could eat all day, every day without gaining weight
                or feeling full, I <b>would.</b> If I ever do you a favor I will 
                most likely ask for food as payment, or a margarita, whatever 
                I'm feeling. I am a punster. I try to find a pun in every 
                conversation if I'm <em>witty</em> enough. Dad jokes? Don't even 
                get me started on those. I love a good 'ol <b>knee slapper.</b> 
                I am always listening to music. I <em>cannot stand</em> a silent 
                room, it's like nails on a chalkboard to me! <b>Not a fan</b> of 
                social media. Get off your phones people and connect with the 
                people around you! I say this in the <em>nicest</em> way possible. 
                I'm a <small>bit</small> of an artist, when I have inspiration,
                that is. I like to draw, paint, color, use pastels and charcoal,
                water colors. I like all them all! As you can tell, I hope, I 
                like all sorts of stuff. I like trying new things too!
